    <span>All paper submissions will be handled electronically. Papers must be submitted electronically in DOC format
      at <b>easychair</b>. Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that
      are simultaneously submitted to a <b>journal</b> or a conference with proceedings. Submitted papers will be peer
      reviewed and carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of
      exposition.
    </span>
    <p><span>The submitted papers must be between 4-6 pages. To facilitate the paper’s double-blind peer review
        process, authors should make efforts to ensure that information about the authors’ identities do not appear
        anywhere in the text-body of the paper and must follow the <b>guidelines</b>.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span>Upon acceptance, at least one of the authors listed in the paper must submit the final paper, attend the
        conference and present the paper according to the schedule of the conference. In the event that the presenter
        is unable to attend the conference for any reasons, your accepted paper will not be considered for submission
        of the proceeding to the <b>IEEE Xplore</b>. </span>
    </p>
    <p><span>Accepted papers after further revisions will be invited for publications in selected journals. Please direct any
      questions about the paper submission process to the program chair at <a class="email">ict4m@iium.edu.my</a>. </span>
    </p>
<br>
  <b>No Show Policy</b>
  <p>Papers that are accepted must be presented at the conference, either by the authors themselves or via a proxy.
In case a paper is not presented at the conference, it shall be deemed a <strong>‘no-show’</strong>. Only presented papers
will be submitted for indexing. <strong>No refund of the paid fees</strong> may be claimed by the <strong>‘no-show’</strong> author. </p>
